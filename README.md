## User story

- [x] **User Story #1:** I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.

- [x] **User Story #2:** I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.

- [x] **User Story #3:** When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the `textarea`.

- [x] **User Story #4:** When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

- [x] **User Story #5:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- [x] **User Story #6:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
